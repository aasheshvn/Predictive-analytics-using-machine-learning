### Implementing Machine-Learning Algorithms on the below datasets

#### Dataset 1: Appliances Energy Usage Prediction
Classification Problem:  Predict the energy usage (High or Low) of the appliances from the varying house temperature and humidity conditions that were monitor by a wireless sensor network. Other attributes like the weather from the nearest airport station are also included in this dataset

#### Dataset 2: Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset
Classification Problem: This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card. Problem to predict whether the client will default the payment next month. Class 0 (No Default): 23365 observations, Class 1 (Default): 6637 observations
