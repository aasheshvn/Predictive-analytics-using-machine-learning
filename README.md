### Implementing Machine-Learning Algorithms on the below datasets

#### Dataset 1: Appliances Energy Usage Prediction
Classification Problem:  Predict the energy usage (High or Low) of the appliances from the varying house temperature and humidity conditions that were monitor by a wireless sensor network. Other attributes like the weather from the nearest airport station are also included in this dataset

#### Dataset 2: Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset
Classification Problem: This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card. Problem to predict whether the client will default the payment next month. Class 0 (No Default): 23365 observations, Class 1 (Default): 6637 observations

#### Dataset 3: Online Shopper's Purchasing Intention 
Online shopping has made our life easy with purchasing the items done in minutes. But it is not everytime that we end up purchasing the item. Or in other words, we can say that there is no guaratanee that customer has the intention to purchase whenever he visits an ecommere website. 

Classification Problem: The goal of this project is analyse the factors that help in determining the visitor purchasing intent and the predict if customer has purchasing intent or not given a new set of test attributes that has various Information related to customer behavior in online shopping websites. The outcome of the project can recommend the employers in targeting customers and help the employers in improvising the marketing strategies.
